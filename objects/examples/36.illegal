Creating a constraint is a kind of side effect, at least potentially,
so another consequence of the prohibition on side effects in
constraint expressions is that methods called from a constraint
expression cannot themselves create other constraints, or call further
methods that do so. The following program is not allowed, and
illustrates side effects resulting from adding constraints in methods
called from other constraints.

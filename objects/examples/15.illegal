Here, assigning a record with a different structure to a is OK on its
own, but the always constraint would also require b to change. Itâ€™s a
bit weird that this behavior is different from the behavior with
primitive types (in which a similar program was OK). However, once we
introduce object identity, we will be able to have changes to the
types of variables ripple through the system via identity constraints
(but it will need to be via identity constraints and not value
constraints).
